# Wordy

Parse and evaluate simple math word problems returning the answer as an integer.

## Iteration 1 — Addition

Add two numbers together.

> What is 5 plus 13?

Evaluates to 18.

Handle large numbers and negative numbers.

## Iteration 2 — Subtraction, Multiplication and Division

Now, perform the other three operations.

> What is 7 minus 5?

2

> What is 6 multiplied by 4?

24

> What is 25 divided by 5?

5

## Iteration 3 — Multiple Operations

Handle a set of operations, in sequence.

Since these are verbal word problems, evaluate the expression from
left-to-right, _ignoring the typical order of operations._

> What is 5 plus 13 plus 6?

24

> What is 3 plus 2 multiplied by 3?

15  (i.e. not 9)

## Bonus — Exponentials

If you'd like, handle exponentials.

> What is 2 raised to the 5th power?

32

## Resources

Remember to check out the Perl 6 [documentation](https://docs.perl6.org/) and
[resources](https://perl6.org/resources/) pages for information, tips, and
examples if you get stuck.

## Running the tests

There is a test script included with the exercise; a file with the extension
`.t`. You can run the test script for the exercise by executing the command
`prove . --exec=perl6` in the exercise directory. You can also add the `-v` flag
e.g. `prove . --exec=perl6 -v` to display all tests, including any optional
tests marked as 'TODO'.
